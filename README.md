Code and scripts from my PhD thesis

Throughout the PhD work I had to write pieces of code to carry out various tasks, from building the network model, to analysing the empirical data, or producing the regional typologies. Snippets of code and some longer scripts have been uploaded to this source code repository in Github: https://github.com/jorgegil/phdThesisCode

The material is organised by thesis chapter, where it is first used, and the name of the files refers to specific sections, figures and tables of the chapters. These files are of various kinds: SQL commands and pl/SQL functions for PostGIS, scripts for R, or command line operations for Mac OSX. The repository also contains small data sets with postcode level analysis results that can be used to reproduce the later stages of the work.

This source code is open for anyone to use and to reproduce or validate the steps of the thesis work. The code is not optimised or necessarily structured for general use, as it was intended for personal use in a set of very specific tasks. For this reason, this release will not be fixed or improved. Nevertheless, some of this code will eventually evolve into new projects, as plugins for QGIS or scripts for R, so suggestions and contributions from others are greatly welcome.
