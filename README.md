# phdThesisCode
Code and scripts from my PhD thesis:
'Urban Modality: Modelling and evaluating the sustainable mobility of urban areas in the city-region'
Research conducted at the TU Delft, Faculty of Architecture, Department of Urbanism, Chair of Spatial Planning and Strategy
Under the supervision of Prof. Vincent Nading and Dr. Stephen Read

Throughout the PhD work I had to write pieces of code to carry out various tasks, from building a multimodal network model, to analysing empirical data, or producing the regional urban form typology. Snippets of code and some longer scripts have been uploaded to this source code repository.

The material is organised by thesis chapter, where it is first used, and the name of the files refers to specific sections, figures and tables of the chapters. These files are of various kinds: SQL commands and pl/SQL functions for PostGIS, scripts for R, or command line operations for Mac OSX. The repository also contains small data sets with postcode level analysis results that can be used to reproduce the later stages of the work.

This source code is open for anyone to use and to reproduce or validate the steps of the thesis work. The code is not optimised or necessarily structured for general use, as it was intended for personal use in a set of very specific tasks. For this reason, this repository will remain static. Nevertheless, some of this code will eventually evolve into new projects, as plugins for QGIS or scripts for R, so suggestions and contributions from others are very welcome.

Hope you find this useful!
